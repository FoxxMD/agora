        <p>Georgia Tech Gamefest is the Southeast's premier video gaming event, featuring hundreds of students competing
            in tournaments.
            In 2007, the Tech tradition of semesterly LAN events was resurrected. With the help of other organizations,
            the first Gamefest had over 300 attendees.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since then, Gamefest has evolved into the largest LAN event in the southeastern United States. In 2012,
            Gamefest surpassed 700 attendees.
            Gamefest has become a collaboration of gaming organizations — near and far — to bring the best LAN events to
            Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
