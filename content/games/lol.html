<p>League of Legends continues to be Gamefest's biggest event, with prizes and tons of swag provided by Riot Games.  League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games inspired by the mod Defense of the Ancients. A match of League of Legends prominently features the strongholds of two opposing factions, containing critical structures called "Nexuses", which are defended by a number of lesser buildings.  The two teams, typically composed of five players each, are pitted against one another to compete as the defenders for their respective Nexus.
