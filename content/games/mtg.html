</div>
<p>MtG Booster Drafts will be held by Cam Adkins during Gamefest.  Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game created by Richard Garfield and first published  by Wizards of the Coast.  A draft consists of eight players selecting cards one at a time from three booster packs. Magic can be played by two or more players each using a deck of printed cards. Each game represents a battle between mighty wizards, known as "planeswalkers", who employ spells, artifacts, and creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their opponents.
