<p>Both Super Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl will be played at Gamefest this year, in response to the popularity of both games.  Super Smash Bros. is a series of fighting games published by Nintendo, featuring characters from established video games. Smash Bros players seek to knock opponents off the stage to remove "Stock" or lives. Characters have a damage total, represented by a percentage value, which rises as they take damage and can exceed 100%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, usually a set of suspended platforms.
