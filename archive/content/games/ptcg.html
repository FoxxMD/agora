<p>Gamefest is proud to announce our very own Pokémon TCG tournament!  This tournament is hosted by our very own Pokémon Professor.  Pokémon TCG is a collectible card game, based on the Pokémon video game series.  Players play Pokémon to the field and use their attacks to reduce the opponent's HP. When a Pokémon's HP is reduced to 0 it is knocked out and the player who knocked it out takes a Prize card into their hand. A player may win the game in 3 ways; by collecting all of their prize cards (initially 6, some cards can increase this), if their opponent runs out of Pokémon on the field or if at the beginning of their opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw in the opponent's deck.
